\chapter{Tools}

\section{Explorer}
ADAMS contains an extended version of the WEKA Explorer. The interface uses
menus instead of buttons to declutter the pre-process tab. Also, it keeps track
of the datasets that the user loads, to make re-loading recent files easier.
This saves a lot of time when working with the same files on a frequent basis.
Furthermore, the user can have an arbitrary number of Explorer sessions in the
same window, distinguished by names. Figure \ref{explorerext} shows the new
interface with the drop-down menu in action.

\end{figure}

One very useful feature is the notion of \textit{workspaces} in this interface.
You can save the current setup (current dataset, classifiers, clusterers, 
evaluation set up, results, etc.) to a file and restore all of it in one go 
again. Unfortunately, not all data can be stored, such as the log, the undo
history and the built models or visualizations associated with a results.
See Figure \ref{explorerext-workspaces} for the button (highlighted in red) 
that allows you to load/save workspaces.

\section{Append datasets}

If you have datasets with the same structure, i.e., exactly the same
attributes, then you can use the \textit{Append datasets} tool to combine
them into a single, large dataset.

The screenshot in Figure \ref{dataset-compatibility} shows the wizard
interface that guides you through the process.

\section{Arff viewer}

WEKA's \textit{Arff viewer} is available from the ADAMS menu as well.

\section{Batch-filter datasets}

Training and test set are required to have exactly the same structure
in WEKA. If you need to apply a pre-processing filter to both of the
files, it is recommended to use \textit{batch-filtering}. This will
ensure that any statistics that get calculated based on the first
dataset, get applied to second file as well. An example for this is
the dictionary of the \textit{StringToWordVector}: the same word
dictionary needs to be applied to the second file, in order to generate
the same attributes. However, one usually has to resort to the command-line
in order to achieve this, which is rather tedious.

The \textit{Batch-filter datasets} wizard allows you to perform the
batch-filtering conveniently through the GUI:
\begin{tight_itemize}
  \item Select the datasets to filter (see \ref{batchfilter_datasets1})
  \item Configure the filter (see \ref{batchfilter_datasets2})
  \item Select the output directory (see \ref{batchfilter_datasets3})
  \item Info dialog after filtering (see \ref{batchfilter_datasets4})
\end{tight_itemize}

  \label{batchfilter_datasets4}
\end{figure}

\section{Dataset compatibility}

WEKA requires training and test sets to have the same structure, down to the
same name and order of nominal labels. Rather than relying on the error message
in the Explorer, you can use the \textit{Dataset compatibility} tool to 
quickly check whether two or more datasets are actually compatible.

The screenshot in Figure \ref{dataset-compatibility} shows the output when
comparing two datases, one being the original \textit{anneal} UCI dataset
and the other one a transformed version.

\section{Merge datasets}
The process of adding reference data to a dataset or performing
\textit{data fusion}\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_fusion}{}},
can be quite often a manual process, copy/pasting datasets in a spreadsheet
application.

The \textit{Merge datasets} wizard allows you to perform the
process of combining datasets side-by-side conveniently in the GUI:
\begin{tight_itemize}
  \item Select the datasets to merge (see \ref{merge_datasets1})
  \item Configure the merge (see \ref{merge_datasets2})
  \item Select the output file (see \ref{merge_datasets3})
  \item Info dialog after merging (see \ref{merge_datasets4})
\end{tight_itemize}
Figure \ref{merge_datasets-output} shows an example of a merged file.
